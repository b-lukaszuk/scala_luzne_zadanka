# Task 1

[Go to: Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

## Description

Write two functions that takes four numbers and returns the smallest. The first can use min, but the second cannot.

# Task 2

[Go to: Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

Write a function that sums all of the digits in an integer number entered by the user. For example, if the user enters 723, the function would return 12 which is equal to 7+2+3.

# Task 3

[Go to: Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

Write two functions for converting between Cartesian and polar coordinate systems. The first takes x:Double and y:Double and returns a (Double, Double) with r and Î¸. The second takes r:Double and theta:Double and returns (Double, Double) with x and y. You can use the Math.atan2(y:Double, x:Double) function to get an angle. This avoids the problem of using division when x is zero.
