# Task 1

Exercise 1 in the chapter 5 of the book.

[Go to: Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

## Description

Write functions that will find either the minimum or the maximum value from numbers input by the user until the user types in “quit”.

# Task 2

Exercise 3 in the chapter 5 of the book.

[Go to: Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

## Description

Write exponentiation using multiplication. Your function only has to work for positive integer values.

# Task 3

Exercise 7 in the chapter 5 of the book.

[Go to: Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

## Description

Write recursive functions that will print a multiplication table up to 10s. Try to get it running first, then consider how you could make everything line up.

# Task 4

Exercise 9 in the chapter 5 of the book.

[Go to: Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

## Description

Write a recursive function called `isPrime` that returns a `Boolean` and lets you know whether or not a number is prime.

# Task 5

Exercise 10 in the chapter 5 of the book.

[Go to: Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

## Description

Write a recursive function that prints the prime factors of a number.

### My Notes

The factor of a number is a number that divides the given number completely without any remainder.

# Task 6

Exercise 11 in the chapter 5 of the book.

[Go to: Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

## Description

Write a recursive function that lets a user play rock, paper, scissors until either the user or the computer wins 3 times. Hint: use `util.random.nextint`.

# Task 7

Exercise 13 in the chapter 5 of the book.

[Go to: Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

## Description

Suppose that tuition at a university costs $30,000 per year and increases 5% per year. Write a recursive function that computes the total cost of tuition a student would pay for a 4-year degree if they started 10 years from now.
