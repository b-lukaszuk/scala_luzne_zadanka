# Task 1

## Description

A) Write a program to convert positive decimals (Int) to binary.

B) Write a program to convert binary to positive decimals (Int).

Bryn just started a new job, but is already thinking of retirement. She wants to retire as a millionaire. She plans on saving $700 per month and expects to receive an annual return of 7%. Will she be a millionaire if she retires in 30 years? Write a script to figure this out.

# Task 3

Write a script that will calculate how far a projectile will go given a launch speed and an angle ignoring friction. Assume that the projectile is launched from ground level with a certain speed in m/s and at a certain angle in radians. Use the fact that acceleration due to gravity is 9.8m/s2 . The steps in doing this would be to calculate the speed parallel and perpendicular to the ground with math.sin and math.cos, then figure out how long it takes for the projectile to slow to a vertical speed of zero (v = v0 − at), and use double that time as how long it stays in the air.

Kepler’s third law of planetary motion says that P^2 ∝ a^3 , where P is the orbital period, and a is the semi-major axis of the orbit. For our Sun, if you measure P in years and a in Astronomical Units (AU), the proportionality becomes equality. Look up the semi-major axis values for three bodies in our solar system other than the Earth and use Scala as a calculator to find the period according to Kepler’s third law.
