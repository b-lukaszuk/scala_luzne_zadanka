## Task 2.1

From years in array check for leap years [1974, 1900, 1985, 2000]

## Task 2.2

Calculate the sum of the odd items [1,6,23,8,4,98,3,7,3,98,4,98]

## Task 2.3

Choose highest and lowest values from the given array. [1,6,23,8,4,98,3,7,3,98,4,98]. One loop run. (chodzi chyba o uzycie for-a 1x, a nie o 1 iteracje/obrot for-a)

## Task 2.4

Choose longest string from the array. [‘Karol’, ‘Adam’,’Rogowski’,’Politechnika’,’Super’,’Weekend’].

tylko 1, czy kilka w przypadku remisow?! (wezme kilka)

## Task 2.5

Choose all the indexes on the highest value from the given array. [1,6,23,8,4,98,3,7,3,98,4,98].

## Task 2.6

Calculate average value from the given array for even numbers [1,6,23,8,4,98,3,7,3,98,4,98]

## Task 2.7

Calculate average value of items at even indexes. Zero is not considered to be even number. [1,6,23,8,4,98,3,7,3,98,4,98]

## Task 2.8

With a given start value of 0. Iterate the array and add even items and subtract odd ones. [1,6,23,8,4,98,3,7,3,98,4,98]

# Task 3

ARRAY: (1,6,23,8,4,8,3,7)

## Task 3.1

Create a function that returns the sum of all elements passed in array as parameter. Function (array)=>number

## Task 3.2

Create a function that returns sum of first and last elements of given array.

## Task 3.3

Create a function that returns given array in reverse order. // no build-in functions :)

# Task 4

## Task 4.1

Create a function that based on given array returns new array in pattern [a,b,c,d,e,f] -> [a+b, c+d, e+f] [1,3,4,1,0,3] => [4,5,3] function(array)=>array

## Task 4.2

For time of this example remove last element from the given array. Create a function that based on given array return new array in pattern [a,b,c,d,e] -> [a+b, c+d, e+e]

## Task 4.3

Create a function the return one random element from given array.

## Task 4.4

Create a function that takes two parameters: array and number off attempts. Based on number of attempts choose a random number from table that many times and return lowest one.

## Task 4.5

Create a function that takes given array. Then takes a random element, removes it from the array and pushes it to result arrays. This takes place as long as there are elements in source array.

## Task 4.6

Create a function that on given array will perform operation of adding or subtracting elements. Operation is to be chosen at random. And return a result.[a,b,c,d] =>(((a+-b)+-c)+-d)

## Task 5.1

Create a function that will return the current day name in Polish.

## Task 5.2

Create a function that tells us how many days till Friday :)

## Task 5.3

Create a function that take two numbers and return the object with 4 fields. Result on 4 basic arithmetic operations.

Show a result of Josephus Problem for 7 soldiers.

Display in the console log below
	a. 1 Kills 2
	b. 3 Kills 4
	c. 5 Kills 6
	d. 7 Kills 1
	e. 3 Kills 5
	f. 7 Kills 3

Write a guessing game where the user has to guess a secret number.
After every guess the program tells the user whether their number was too large or too small.
At the end the number of tries needed should be printed.
It counts only as one try if they input the same number multiple times consecutively (I'll make it no repetitions count, not just consecutive ones).
Range 1-100.

# Task 10

Write a function that rotates a list by k elements. For example [1,2,3,4,5,6] rotated by two becomes [3,4,5,6,1,2].

# Task 11

Write a class that prints the list of the first n Fibonacci numbers. The first two Fibonacci numbers are 1 and 1.
The n+1-st Fibonacci number can be computed by adding the n-th and the n-1-th Fibonacci number.
The first few are therefore 1, 1, 1+1=2, 1+2=3, 2+3=5, 3+5=8.

Write function that translates a text to Pig Latin and back.
English is translated to Pig Latin by taking the first letter of every word, moving it to the end of the word and adding ‘ay’.
“The quick brown fox” becomes “Hetay uickqay rownbay oxfay”.
