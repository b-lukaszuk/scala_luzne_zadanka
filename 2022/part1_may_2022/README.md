# Task 1

[Go to: Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

# Task 2.1

From years in array check for leap years [1974, 1900, 1985, 2000]

# Task 2.2

Calculate the sum of the odd items [1,6,23,8,4,98,3,7,3,98,4,98]

# Task 2.3

Choose highest and lowest values from the given array. [1,6,23,8,4,98,3,7,3,98,4,98]. One loop run. (chodzi chyba o uzycie for-a 1x, a nie o 1 iteracje/obrot for-a)

# Task 2.4

Choose longest string from the array. [‘Karol’, ‘Adam’,’Rogowski’,’Politechnika’,’Super’,’Weekend’].

tylko 1, czy kilka w przypadku remisow?! (wezme kilka)

# Task 2.5

Choose all the indexes on the highest value from the given array. [1,6,23,8,4,98,3,7,3,98,4,98].

# Task 2.6

Calculate average value from the given array for even numbers [1,6,23,8,4,98,3,7,3,98,4,98]

# Task 2.7

Calculate average value of items at even indexes. Zero is not considered to be even number. [1,6,23,8,4,98,3,7,3,98,4,98]

# Task 2.8

With a given start value of 0. Iterate the array and add even items and subtract odd ones. [1,6,23,8,4,98,3,7,3,98,4,98]

# Task 3

ARRAY: (1,6,23,8,4,8,3,7)

## Task 3.1

Create a function that returns the sum of all elements passed in array as parameter. Function (array)=>number

## Task 3.2

Create a function that returns sum of first and last elements of given array.

## Task 3.3

Create a function that returns given array in reverse order. // no build-in functions :)

# Task 4

## Task 4.1

Create a function that based on given array returns new array in pattern [a,b,c,d,e,f] -> [a+b, c+d, e+f] [1,3,4,1,0,3] => [4,5,3] function(array)=>array

## Task 4.2

For time of this example remove last element from the given array. Create a function that based on given array return new array in pattern [a,b,c,d,e] -> [a+b, c+d, e+e]

## Task 4.3

Create a function the return one random element from given array.

## Task 4.4

Create a function that takes two parameters: array and number off attempts. Based on number of attempts choose a random number from table that many times and return lowest one.

## Task 4.5

Create a function that takes given array. Then takes a random element, removes it from the array and pushes it to result arrays. This takes place as long as there are elements in source array.

## Task 4.6

Create a function that on given array will perform operation of adding or subtracting elements. Operation is to be chosen at random. And return a result.[a,b,c,d] =>(((a+-b)+-c)+-d)

# Task 5

## Task 5.1

Create a function that will return the current day name in Polish.

## Task 5.2

Create a function that tells us how many days till Friday :)

## Task 5.3

Create a function that take two numbers and return the object with 4 fields. Result on 4 basic arithmetic operations.
