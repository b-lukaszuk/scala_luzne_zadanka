Tasks 1-2 come from [Rosetta Code](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Programming_Tasks) lthough they might have been modified by me.

# Task 1

[Go to: Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

The task comes from: [Rosetta Code](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Anagrams)

## Description

When two or more words are composed of the same characters, but in a different order, they are called anagrams.

Using the word list at http://wiki.puzzlers.org/pub/wordlists/unixdict.txt, find the sets of words that share the same characters that contain the most words in them.

# Task 2

[Go to: Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

The task comes from: [Rosetta Code](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Babbage_problem)

## Description

Charles Babbage, looking ahead to the sorts of problems his Analytical Engine would be able to solve, gave this example:

> What is the smallest positive integer whose square ends in the digits 269,696?
â€” Babbage, letter to Lord Bowden, 1837; see Hollingdale and Tootill, Electronic Computers, second edition, 1970, p. 125.

He thought the answer might be 99,736, whose square is 9,947,269,696; but he couldn't be certain.

The aim of the task is to write a program that is sufficiently clear and well-documented for such a person to be able to read it and be confident that it does indeed solve the specified problem.
